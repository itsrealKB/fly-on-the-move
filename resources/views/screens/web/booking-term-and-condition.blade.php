                                    email, as agent for the Travel Provider, to confirm acceptance of your booking. The
                                    contract between you and the Travel Provider will only be made when we send you this
                                    email, as agent for the Travel Provider, to confirm acceptance. We will charge your
                                    chosen payment method after we accept your booking. The Travel Provider will send you a
                                    further email when your booking has been processed containing the details of the Travel
                                    Offer booked, including all relevant confirmation documentation as may be required if
                                    you have booked a Product with a Travel Provider.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>3) Once your booking has been confirm by the Travel Provider and FOTM, and once you have
                                    paid, totally or partially (according booking conditions), for your Travel Offer, FOTM

                                <p>4) In the event that tickets and/or travel documents do not arrive by post or email, FOTM
                                    will not be responsible. Please contact the Travel Provider identified in the booking
                                    receipt email directly should you not receive these documents.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>5) All bookings for Travel Offers are subject to the availability of those Travel Offers
                                    as notified by the relevant Travel Providers. We will inform you as soon as possible
                                    after placing a booking if, for any reason, the Travel Offer you have sought to book
                                    with a Travel Provider is not available.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>6) If a Travel Provider is unable to accept your booking because, for example, the Travel
                                    Provider has no more vacancies remaining on your chosen dates, or because of an error in
                                    the price we will inform you of this by email and we will not process your booking. If
                                    you have already paid for the Travel Offers we will arrange with the Travel Providers
                                    for monies paid to be refunded to you in full as soon as possible.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>7) The price of any Travel Offer will be shown in US Dollars and quoted as it is shown on
                                    the respective price list that appear on the Travel Offer, except in cases of obvious
                                    error. The Travel Offer may offer different payment conditions (in example, full price
                                    payment required&nbsp; to confirm the booking, or 50% of the price must be deposit in
                                    advance due to confirm the booking, among others). The price of a Travel Offer includes
                                    VAT, together with any other relevant taxes applicable to the product. The price of any
                                    Travel Offer may change from time to time, but changes will not affect any booking that
                                    a Travel Provider has already accepted. Due to the large number of Travel Offers on the
                                    Service, it is always possible that some of the Travel Offers listed on the Service may
                                    be incorrectly priced, despite our reasonable efforts to make sure that they are
                                    accurately priced. We will normally verify prices with Travel Providers as part of our
                                    booking-handling procedure so that, where a Travel Offer’s correct price is less than
                                    the stated price, we will charge the lower amount when accepting the booking from you,
                                    as agent for the Travel Provider. If the Travel Offer’s correct price is higher than the
                                    price stated on the Service, we will normally, and at our discretion, either contact you
                                    for instructions before processing your booking, or reject your booking on behalf of the
                                    Travel Provider and notify you of the rejection. Please note that the Travel Provider is
                                    under no obligation to agree to supply the Travel Offer to you at the incorrect (lower)
                                    price, even after we have sent you a booking receipt, if the pricing error is obvious
                                    and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognized by you as a mispricing.</p>
                                <p>Booking fee: We may charge a booking fee for providing you with the Service. This Service
                                    includes the using of the platform we provide for you to purchase the Travel Offer from
                                    the Travel Provider. The booking fee will be set out with the other payment details on
                                    the final page before you pay for the Travel Offer. You agree that by making a booking
                                    with a Travel Provider through our Service you are under an obligation to pay us the

                                <p>9) Payment: We act as a payment agent for the Travel Provider. We accept payment
                                    from&nbsp;&nbsp; you on behalf of the Travel Provider using the payment methods listed
                                    on the Service and or the travel Offer. You must pay for the Travel Offer at the time
                                    you make the booking for the Travel Offer. By making a booking through the Service, you
                                    are confirming that the payment details provided on booking are valid and correct. If
                                    any payment method is rejected, we may contact you requesting an alternative payment
                                    method or we may cancel your booking. If you have any query about an amount that has

                                    us straight away. In the event that we find a payment has been taken in error we will
                                    refund the amount immediately to your credit, debit card or bank account. FOTM does not
                                    charge an extra fee for processing your payment. But one of the parties that take part
                                    on the payment process (i.e. Credit Card Company, Bank) may charge some fee. , FOTM does
                                    provide a booking confirmation which can be used as a receipt as it shows the amount
                                    paid at the time of booking.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>We only accept payments by credit or debit card or via Pay Pal or Bank wire transfer. For
                                    your convenience and in order to safeguard your payment information, all payments are

                                    you have entered all relevant information correctly, payments will be taken

                                    Member will need to offer to purchase a Product on the Website and accept the present
                                    BTC; ii) Automatically, FOTM will issue an online acknowledgment confirming receipt of
                                    the booking request; iii) FOTM will check availability contacting the relevant Travel
                                    Provider; iv) If the Travel Provider confirm availability, and after FOTM and Travel
                                    Provider check there are not accidentals errors, mistakes or omissions on the Travel
                                    Offer or Product, FOTM will notify by email to the Member that the booking can be
                                    confirmed; v) Due to finally confirm the Booking, the Member must pay or deposit the
                                    price according the terms that the chosen Travel Offer demand, and this payment must be
                                    confirmed by FOTM; vi) Once your booking has&nbsp; been completed and payment for your
                                    Product has been made, FOTM will issue you with a booking receipt, in compliance with
                                    applicable laws, with details of the relevant Travel Provider providing the Product that
                                    you have booked.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>11) Modifications, Cancellations or Alterations after payment:</p>
                                <p>by Members: *Unless otherwise stated in the Product description, once Payment
                                    confirmation has taken place all Product sales on the Website (or otherwise) are final,
                                    non-refundable and may not be altered, and cancellation will result in the forfeiture of
                                    the entire amount paid by the Member for the Product. If alterations or cancellations
                                    are available from the Travel Provider, they may be subject to a charge as per the
                                    Travel Provider’s own terms and conditions. *While bookings made through the FOTM
                                    Website have a 100% non-cancellable/non-refundable policy, if a Member wishes to make a
                                    change to their booking of a Product with a Travel Provider, then FOTM has the right, in
                                    its discretion, to assist a Member in the Member’s attempts to alter or cancel a
                                    booking, but can give no guarantee that such attempts will be successful. FOTM will not
                                    be held liable for any applicable charges that the Member may need to pay in order to
                                    give effect to any such alteration or cancellation, if available. *Please note that if a
                                    Travel Provider separate terms and conditions, located on its own website or otherwise,
                                    include provisions relating to changes and cancellations of bookings, such terms shall
                                    not be binding on the Travel Provider when bookings are made for Products featured on
                                    the Website. This is because of the pre-negotiated rates that FOTM has managed to secure
                                    with the Travel Provider, which is generally on the basis that the booking is final and
                                    cannot be changed. Members should therefore be aware that any such cancellation or
                                    alteration terms or provisions relating to Products booked through the Website would be
                                    deemed as non-cancellable and non-refundable, unless otherwise expressly stated, or
                                    unless the Travel Provider has agreed to this in writing. *Depending on the reason for
                                    cancellation, you may be able to reclaim any cancellation charges payable (less any
                                    applicable excess) under the terms of any insurance policy that you may choose to
                                    separately procure in respect to the Product. All claims must be made directly to the
                                    insurance company concerned.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>11.2.- by Travel Provider: Since FOTM Services are concluded after the booking has been
                                    confirmed and the payment has been done and since you are on a direct agreement
                                    relationship with the Travel Provider, if the Travel Provider cancels or makes changes
                                    to the purchased Travel Offer, FOTM will not be responsible for any costs incurred by
                                    you. So, in the rare cases that a Travel Provider cancels your booking after it has been
                                    accepted, you will be notified by the Travel Provider or FOTM acting on the Travel
                                    Provider’s behalf. As FOTM is an agent acting on behalf of Travel Providers, and your
                                    contract for the Travel Offer is with the Travel Provider, we will use reasonable
                                    endeavours to assist you in getting a refund or changing your dates. However, FOTM will
                                    not be responsible for any costs associated with a cancellation by the Travel Provider.
                                </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>12) Insurance: We consider adequate travel insurance to be essential to cover you during
                                    and with respect to your travel. Please ensure that your valid travel insurance policy
                                    is valid from the time of booking your holiday for the countries you will be travelling
                                    to or through, and to cover the activities that you may undertake while you are on
                                    vacation. We further recommend that all members of the party booked are covered by the
                                    policy (in case of families) or have their own adequate policy in place.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>13) If FOTM fails to comply with these BTS, we will be responsible for the loss or damage
                                    you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms of Service or our
                                    negligence, but we will not be responsible for any loss or damage that is not
                                    foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if the loss or damage was an obvious
                                    consequence of our breach or if the loss or damage was contemplated by you and us at the
                                    time we entered into the contract. The maximum loss or damage we will be responsible for
                                    is limited to the booking rate you paid us when using the Service to purchase a Travel
                                    Offer to which the loss or damage you suffer relates.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>14) Events outside our control: We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to
                                    perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under a contract that is
                                    caused by events outside our reasonable control including (but not limited to) acts of
                                    god, fire, flood, severe weather, explosions, war (whether declared or not), acts of
                                    terrorism, industrial disputes (whether or not involving our employees), or acts of
                                    local or central Government or of any other competent authorities.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
